Evaluation of the Essential 
----------------------------

This year in May at CodeGeneration 2011 in Cambridge also took place the 

	Language Workbench Competition 2011

Shortened to LWC 2011.

The goal of this event was to get a  comparison of the 'workbenches' by a given task.

The assignment for the LWC 2011 can be found here:

	http://www.languageworkbenches.net/LWCTask-1.0.pdf  

Which means that all candidates had to solve the same problem with theirs own tools.

You can watch a small video round-up at

	http://www.languageworkbenches.net/ 

For the interested one's among yourselves there is also a feature matrix of the introduced workbenches.

To come back, now I try myself to find out the strengths and the weaknesses of some of the workbenches.

I will start with Essential.

And here as well the project URL:
